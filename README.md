# hikikomero-tagger
this is a "stripped down" version of my school project ImageMTDT ("hikikomero" repository).
this basically only allows you to edit the artist and tags of jpg images instead of all metadata


here are the hotkeys it uses for navigation and such

(All require you to press CTRL + Key showed)

N => next image

B => previous image

S => puts focus on tag search

T => puts focus on tag add box

D => opens folder select

R => refreshes the current folder

DELETE => deletes currently displayed image (will ask for confirmation)

Q => gets everything from current image file name until first "-" and puts it as the artist

Y => puts focus on artist add box

H => puts focus on the currently displayed image count
